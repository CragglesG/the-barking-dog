# The Barking Dog
A creation made using a Raspberry Pi 4B, a HQ Camera, a speaker, and a PIR sensor, along with a small bit of python. When running, the RPi will play an audio file of a dog barking every time it detects a rabbit. (It can be easily modified to bark at almost anything.)

The Barking Dog uses the following libraries:
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `RPi.GPIO`
-
